Real Market provides information on all flea market schedules & local hotples in Korea.

As an online flea market, we support not only various used transactions, but also a marketplace for transactions by linking with local members and small business owners of the flea market such as beads crafts, handmade products, beauty products, accessories, and household goods.

We have created an environment where direct transactions can be made safely in nearby areas and delivery transactions over long distances, and a real pay system has been introduced to activate transactions and provide compensation plans.
